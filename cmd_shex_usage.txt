  -t
  --force-tty
    Allocate a PTY for remote command's standard streams
    even when CMD is given

  -T
  --disable-tty
    Never give the remote command a pseudo-terminal for its
    standard streams.

  -E EXENAME
  --exename EXENAME
    Run EXENAME on remote host.  Default is CMD, which becomes
    argv[0] in any case.

  -r
  --root
    Run remote command or shell as root.

  -u USER
  --user USER
    Run remote command or shell as USER.

  -U
  --socket
    Use a socketpair for child stdin and stdout.

  -D
  --no-ctty
    Run child without a controlling terminal.  On disconnect,
    child will not receive SIGHUP as it normally would.

  -C DIR
  --chdir DIR
    Change to DIR before executing child.

  -X TRANSPORT
  --transport TRANSPORT
    Connect over the given transport.  The default is "shell".

    "shell" means to run the fb-adb protocol over an "adb shell"
    connection.  This method is the most reliable.

    "unix" means to run the fb-adb protocol over an AF_UNIX socket
    connection forwarded over ADB.  This method may transfer data
    faster than the shell transport, but it is experimental may take
    slightly longer to set up.

    "tcp:HOST,PORT" means to use a TCP socket to connect from the
    device to the host.  fb-adb automatically manages making the
    connection, but it cannot automatically figure out on what network
    address the device can reach the host.  You must tell it what
    address to bind to: HOST and PORT.  HOST and PORT are any strings
    accepted as the node and service arguments, respectively, to
    getaddr(3), and can by names or numbers.

      Examples: "tcp:10.2.5.1,12345" and "tcp:myhost.example,gopher"

    This transport is typically much faster than the others: it
    bypasses adb completely.

    Note that traffic on this connection is unencrypted.

  -Y NAME=VALUE
  --setenv NAME=VALUE
    Set the environment variable NAME to VALUE in the child.

    fb-adb begins with the default environment inherited from the
    shell.  fb-adb then applies the environment modifications
    described by -Y, -K, and -F in order.  The child inherits the
    resulting environment.

  -K NAME
  --unsetenv NAME
    Unset the environment variable NAME in the child.

  -F
  --clearenv
    Unset all environment variables in the child.

  -h
  --help
    Display this message.

  -d, -e, -s, -p, -H, -P
    Control the device to which fb-adb connects.  See adb help.
